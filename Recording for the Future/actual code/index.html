'<strong>Western Classical Music - Medieval</strong><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9360B1AoPE" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Medieval music</a> is well known for its church oriented Gregorian chants, with only male voices. It was monophonic, which meant everyone sang the same note without any harmony or chords. The composer, Pérotin, was the one who invented polyphony, or harmony, meaning that he had different singers singing different parts and notes to create harmony to make music. All of the texts and lyrics are in Latin as the singers sang the Latin lyrics in churches. There was almost no secular, or common, music, as only the church music was respected and represented in society. </p>',

'<strong>Western Classical Music - Renaissance</strong><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RajAq0Yd-s4" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Renaissance music</a> was in fact the &#39;renaissance&#39; of Western Classical Music. Polyphony and dynamics were introduced to the music created in this time as more instruments were developed. While music was still heavily church oriented, rich families, known as patrons, hired musicians to compose pieces for them. It moved on from the Grand Staff used in the Medieval Era to the 5 line staff as well. It was in this era that the cornerstones of development were laid, leading to further development of music in the following eras.</p>',

'<strong>Western Classical Music - Classical</strong><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E6b3swbnWg" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Classical music</a> may be the most well known era of music to us today. It saw composers like Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, Liszt, Paganini, and Monti shine and receive the spotlights. The concept of a &#39;virtuoso&#39; became a phenomenon as talented musicians like Liszt and Paganini, especially, took centre stage and composed difficult and embellished pieces. The pieces composed by the virtuosos of this time are considered to be the standard of skill to musicians today, through pieces like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PZaLAGcNlQ" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Caprice No. 24</a> by Paganini with its extremely technical requirements like richochets and trills.

'<strong>Western Classical Music - Romantic</strong><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ifj8dwuAzAQ" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Romantic music</a>, as the name suggests was very emotional and intense in its dynamics. It also showcased large orchestras and further use of the piano as a mainstream instrument. This was also when subjects like nature and nationalism took over the theme of the music from religion. Fueled by different social events like the French Revolution, the music in this era takes a nationalistic stance, with several compositions reflecting this change. Furthermore, the emotional aspect was fueled by the focus on nature, of which some composers took it as a subject to their piece.</p> ',

'<strong>Western Classical Music - Contemporary</strong><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBsKplb2E6Q" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Contemporary music</a> is comprised of experimental ideas, with different combinations of instruments and harmonization that went against the norms of the classical times, using dissonance as a tool to create music. It reflects the turbulent times of the era, with the World Wars and social movements like the Russian Revolution. There is a large variance on the likeability of this music as some prefer harmonious music over dissonace.',

'<strong>Saudi Arabia</strong><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SZArprD9pw" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Saudi traditional music</a> is quite limited. However, the migratory lifestyle of the bedouin mitigated against carrying excess baggage, including musical instruments. Simple rhythms, with the beat counted by clapping or striking together everyday implements formed the basis of the music. Instruments like the double-reeded ney or the stringed rababa were sometimes used, after being obtained in cosmopolitan cities such as Jeddah. However, music is considered "sinful" by some Muslims, including Salah Al Budair who is the Imam of the Grand mosque in Medina. This is based in part on certain Ahadith which speak negatively of non-percussion musical instruments.</p>',

Music in India began as an integral part of socio-religious life. Furthermore, India&#39;s music uses a different scale and notation system to the Western style of music and notations. This is why it is almost impossible to play western music on Indian instruments and vice versa as it is impossible to recreate the same sound at the same pitch with these instruments.</p>',
